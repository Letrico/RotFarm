# RotFarm

This is beta test release for rot farm.

All it does is it will teleport around to find area with season event happening, walk around kill things ONLY, does not do any events or claim whisper cache.

It will also approach and interact cocoon if it sees it. Will stay around big cocoon to kill husks too.

Salvage only works with alfred so please get alfred.
